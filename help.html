        If you are experiencing the symptom, except for trouble breathing, don't not go to the hospital. In most cases you, are not going to get a spot, then there is a huge demand with critical situations that really tops you over. 
      </p>
      <p> 
        You should stay home and separate youself from your family members if you are lightly infected, drink lots of water, cover yourself with blankets and do the same order like you would with a cold/flu.

        If you having trouble breathing, call 911 and health hot lines. But prepare your money... becuase if you are not serious, the price you are going to can give a man a heart attack, not really, but just to <a href="https://www.theweek.in/news/health/2020/04/11/mumbai-patient-alleges-overcharging-at-private-hospital-for-covid9-testing.html"> demonstrate the price you might pay</a>.
