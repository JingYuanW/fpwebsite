        Cornora Virus, more commonly known as Covid-19, is a new virus found around Wuhan, China around the end of 2019. And this is used to inform you to stay concerned of it and stay in, from personal experience, and from the world, take some time, and believe in this.

        With it spreading around China, and was very simliar to other cornavirus, for exmaple <a href="https://www.who.int/ith/diseases/sars/en/"> SARS</a>, with similar symptoms. This alerted countries into panicing and preparing for the worst.
      </p>

        There is currently no vaccine as of I am writing for this type of virus, there is not even helpful drugs. So it's best to isolate yourself from public to not contract it.

        The virus had made the world's stock market fall enormously ever since the few decades, some rose due to circumstances. People are panicing over resources need to survive and <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/02/grocery-stores-coronavirus-panic-buying/">shopping sites are flooding with people</a>. This causes an uproar from the public demanding for their safety. 
      </p>
      <p> 
        With frights like these, terror struck and many hide. Some don't care saying they won't and they are there to live life and virus isn't going to stop them, which is normal for human beings in many's eyes. But things did go a bad turn as there are <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/new-york-city-sees-more-burglaries-of-businesses-under-coronavirus-emergency-measures-11586008801"> store raids,</a> trespassing, and <a href="https://www.ktsm.com/news/report-sams-club-stabbing-suspect-thought-family-was-chinese-infecting-people-with-coronavirus/"> killing<a>  done under such fear.
