        There is currently no safe options out there that will lift you from this virus. Certain drugs may help you recover and get over the harsh time you are experiencing with the virus. Otherwise, there is currently no major drugs and vaccines for the virus.

      <p> 
        The vacine is said to be least a year from public general use, but they have big developements and the researches have high hope. Even thought there is no animal testing but straight into human testings, there is signs of the vacine being developed properly and as fast as possible to minimum the number of death caused by the virus.

        Certain drugs as I said, might make the situation better for you, but there is currently no specific drug used for the virus, few are still in testing and might be months before we can get access to them safely.
